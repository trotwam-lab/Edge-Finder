// This is the props_backup file - a snapshot of an earlier version of App.jsx
// that had props functionality built directly into the main component.
// Kept for reference. See the modular version in src/components/ for the current code.
// [PLACEHOLDER - This is a large legacy backup file (~23KB) containing an older monolithic version of the app]
