# When to Form an LLC for EdgeFinder

## The Trigger Points

Form an LLC when you hit **ANY** of these:

| Trigger | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|
| **$1,000+/month revenue** | Liability protection becomes worth the cost |
| **First paying customer** | You have obligations to fulfill now |
| **Hiring anyone** (even contractors) | Workers comp, payroll taxes, contracts |
| **You have assets to protect** (house, savings) | Lawsuit could wipe out personal stuff |
| **Raising money / taking investment** | Investors won't write checks to "some dude" |
| **Serious media coverage** | Looks amateur to be a sole prop at scale |

**For you specifically:** With 3 kids and a night shift job, the liability protection alone might be worth it once you hit ~50 paying customers.

## EdgeFinder Business Plan (One-Page)

### The Problem
Sports bettors lose because they don't have real-time edge data. They guess. They chase. They burn money.

### The Solution
EdgeFinder — real-time betting edges, injury alerts, line movements, value picks. $9.99/month Pro tier.

### Revenue Model
| Tier | Price | What You Get |
|------|-------|--------------|
| Free | $0 | Basic odds, 3 picks/day |
| Pro | $9.99/mo | All edges, injury alerts, props, unlimited picks |
| Lifetime | $199 one-time | Pro forever (for whales) |

### Unit Economics (Conservative)
- **CAC** (Customer Acquisition Cost): ~$15 (organic Twitter + some ads)
- **LTV** (Lifetime Value): $60 (avg 6 month retention)
- **LTV:CAC Ratio**: 4:1 ✅ (healthy is 3:1+)
- **Gross Margin**: 85% (Stripe fees ~3%, hosting ~$20/mo, API ~$50/mo)

### Growth Targets
| Month | Subscribers | MRR | Annual Run Rate |
|-------|-------------|-----|-----------------|
| 1 | 10 | $100 | $1,200 |
| 3 | 50 | $500 | $6,000 |
| 6 | 200 | $2,000 | $24,000 |
| 12 | 500 | $5,000 | $60,000 |

**At 500 subscribers:** That's $60k/year on a $9.99 app. LLC + S-Corp election saves you ~$8-10k in taxes vs sole prop.

### Marketing Channels (Ranked)
1. **Twitter/X daily content** — your main funnel
2. **YouTube show** — builds authority, drives signups
3. **Twitch** — live reactions, real-time engagement
4. **Newsletter** — retention, upsells
5. **Discord community** — engagement, word of mouth

### Risks
- **Stripe shuts you down** (gambling-adjacent) → Have backup payment processor ready
- **API costs spike** → Rate limit free tier, upsell heavy users
- **Competition** → Speed + personality + your picks history wins

### Why You Win
- You're already doing the content (YouTube, Twitter, Twitch)
- You know the audience (you ARE the audience)
- First-mover in "edge + personality" space (not just data)

## When the LLC Actually Pays Off

**Tax Example:**

| Scenario | Sole Prop | LLC (S-Corp) |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| $60,000 profit | ~$18k self-employment tax | ~$9k salary + $9k distribution = ~$12k total |
| **Savings** | — | **~$6,000/year** |

At $60k/year, the LLC saves you more than it costs. Below $30k, it's break-even. Above $30k, it prints money.

## My Recommendation

**Phase 1 (Now - Month 2):** Launch as sole prop, validate people pay
**Phase 2 (Month 3-4):** Hit 50 subscribers, open business bank account, track everything
**Phase 3 (Month 5-6):** Form LLC + S-Corp election if you're on track for $30k+ year one

Don't let paperwork slow the launch. But don't sleep on the tax savings either once it's working.
